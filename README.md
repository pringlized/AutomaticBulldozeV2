# AutomaticBulldozeV2

Forked from mexahuk61/AutomaticBulldozeV2

Initial ideas:
- Create a department of demolition
- Department should have X numbers of available "crews" to demolish
- Eash crew has to drive to the location and work on the demo.  No idea how long that should take at the moment
- The department has a budget that determines the size of the fleet.
- Maybe you could have multiple "stations" when your land expands and your city is huge
- Never seen one demolished, but a highrise building should take longer to demo than a single family home
  - Time maybe should be based on the size and density of the building?
- Does demo create traffic problems?
- Need to build the "demo" department building
  - Need to build the "demo" crew.  Single vehicle doesn't seem right.  Feels like multiple vehicles are needed
  - Possible vehicles: high-reach excavator, demo ball, dumpsters, hauling trucks, etc
- Ohh and assets.  Need to build the department building and the individual vehicles in Blender
